## Thanks for installing Cordova {VERSION}!

## Plugins

* Plugins **MUST** add their plugin mapping to their app's Cordova.plist Plugins key, if not they will not work (see your plugin's README)
* Plugins **MUST** add any external hosts they connect to to the white-list in Cordova.plist/ExternalHosts (add hostnames **only**)
* A plugin's Objective-C code **MUST** be added to the project properly in a "group" (**YELLOW** folder), if you incorrectly added it as a folder reference it would be a blue folder (just delete the reference, and re-add)
* A lot of plugins have changed their mapping names in Cordova.plist, you might have to copy and use the new Cordova.plist in your app.

## Upgraders
	
1. Please see the "Cordova Upgrade Guide" included in the .dmg distribution, in the "Guides" sub-folder
2. See the FAQ in the README.pdf as well

<br />

## Xcode 4

1. Launch Xcode 4
2. Select "New Project..." then under the File menu
3. Select "Application", under the "iOS" section
4. Select "Cordova-based Application" then in the right pane
5. Select the "Next" button
6. Name your project and bundle identifier
7. Select the "Next" button
8. Choose the location where you want the new project to be

<br />

**IMPORTANT:** On first run, it will create a sample "www" folder for you inside your project. After that, you MUST drag and drop the "www" folder into your project in Xcode, to create a **folder reference** for it (**BLUE** folder).
<br />

**IMPORTANT:** For the "CoreMedia", "UIKit" and "AVFoundation" frameworks, you MUST set the linkage as "Optional", if not iOS 3.x devices will crash. The linkage type could not be set in the template itself (undocumented).
<br />

**NOTE:** In post-1.0.0 releases, new project templates have these 3 frameworks specified above weak linked through linker flags during compile time, and you will not have to do this manually anymore.
<br />

That's it! Modify the contents of the "www" directory to add your HTML, CSS and Javascript.
