# Cordova Upgrade Guide #

This document is for developers who need to upgrade their Cordova-based projects to a newer Cordova version. Starting with Cordova 1.4.0, Cordova has been re-factored to use Cleaver (Cordova as a Component), and some classes that were used before have been removed - namely PhoneGapDelegate and PhoneGapViewController.

- To upgrade from 1.3.0 to 1.6.0, please go to the 1.4.0 instructions first, then 1.5.0, then 1.6.0
- To upgrade from 1.4.x to 1.6.0, please go to the 1.5.0 instructions first, then 1.6.0
- To upgrade from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0, go straight to the 1.6.0 instructions

## Upgrading Cordova 1.5.0 projects to 1.6.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.6.0
2. **Make a backup** of **AppDelegate.m**, **AppDelegate.h**, **MainViewController.m**, **MainViewController.h**, and **Cordova.plist** in your project
3. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project
4. **Copy** these files from the **new** project into your 1.5.0 based project folder on disk, **replacing** any old files (**backup** your files first from step 2 above):

        AppDelegate.h
        AppDelegate.m
        MainViewController.h
        MainViewController.m
        Cordova.plist
5. **Add** all the new **MainViewController** and **AppDelegate** files into your Xcode project
6. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.6.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.5.0.js** file
7. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.6.0.js** file
8. **Add** the new **Cordova.plist** file into your project - this is because the core plugin service names needed to be changed to match the ones from Android and Blackberry, for a unified Cordova JavaScript file (cordova-js). 
9. **Integrate** any settings, **Plugins** and **ExternalHosts** entries that you had in your **backed-up Cordova.plist** into the new **Cordova.plist**
10. **Integrate** any project specific code that you have in your **backed-up AppDelegate.h and AppDelegate.m** into the new AppDelegate files. Any **UIWebViewDelegate** or **CDVCommandDelegate** code in **AppDelegate.m** will need to go into MainViewController.m now (see commented out sections in that file)
11. **Integrate** any project specific code that you have in your **backed-up MainViewController.h and MainViewController.m** into the new MainViewController files
12. Click on the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your **Project**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
13. Enter **"Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C"** in the search field
14. Select the **"Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1"** value


## Upgrading Cordova 1.4.x projects to 1.5.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.5.0
2. **Create a new project** and run it once - you will have to grab assets from this new project
3. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.5.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/phonegap-1.4.x.js** file
4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new Cordova **cordova-1.5.0.js** file
5. Find **"PhoneGap.framework"** in your Project Navigator, select it
6. Press the **Delete** key and delete the **"PhoneGap.framework"** reference in the Project Navigator
7. Press the key combination **Option-Command-A**, which should drop down a sheet to add files to your project (the **"Add Files..." sheet**). Make sure the **"Created groups for any added folders"** radio-button is selected
8. Press the key combination **Shift-Command-G**, which should drop down another sheet for you to go to a folder (the **"Go to the folder:" sheet**)
9. Enter **"/Users/Shared/Cordova/Frameworks/Cordova.framework"** in the **"Go to the folder:" sheet** and then press the **"Go"** button
10. Press the **"Add"** button in the **"Add Files..." sheet**
11. **Select "Cordova.framework"** in the Project Navigator
12. Press the key combination **Option-Command-1** to show the **File Inspector**
13. Choose **"Absolute Path"** in the **File Inspector** for the drop-down menu for **Location**
14. Press the key combination **Option-Command-A**, which should drop down a sheet to add files to your project (the **"Add Files..." sheet**). Make sure the **"Created groups for any added folders"** radio-button is selected
15. Press the key combination **Shift-Command-G**, which should drop down another sheet for you to go to a folder (the **"Go to the folder:" sheet**)
16. Enter **"~/Documents/CordovaLib/Classes/deprecated"** in the **"Go to the folder:" sheet** and then press the **"Go"** button
17. Press the **"Add"** button in the **"Add Files..." sheet**
18. In your **AppDelegate.h, AppDelegate.m, and MainViewController.h** files - replace the whole **#ifdef PHONEGAP_FRAMEWORK** block with:

        #import "CDVDeprecated.h"
19. Click on the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your **Target**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
20. Search for **"Framework Search Paths"**
21. Replace the existing value with **"/Users/Shared/Cordova/Frameworks"** 
22. Search for **"Preprocessor Macros"**
23. For the first (combined) value, replace the value with **"CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK=YES"**
24. Select the **"Build Phases"** tab
25. Expand **"Run Script"**
26. Replace any occurrences of **PhoneGap** with **Cordova**
27. Find your **"PhoneGap.plist"** file in the Project Navigator, and click on the filename once to enter name edit mode
28. Rename **"PhoneGap.plist"** to **"Cordova.plist"**
29. Right-click on **"Cordova.plist"** and choose **"Open As" --> "Source Code"**
30. Press **Option-Command-F**, choose **"Replace"** from the drop-down on the top left of the Source window
31. Enter **com.phonegap** for the Find string, and **org.apache.cordova** for the Replace string - then press the **"Replace All"** button
32. Enter **PG** for the Find string, and **CDV** for the Replace string - then press the **"Replace All"** button
33. Press **Command-B** to build, you will still have deprecations that you can get rid of in the future (see **CDVDeprecated.h** - replace classes in your code that use PG* to CDV*, for example)

6. **Integrate** any project specific code that you have in your **backed-up MainViewController.m** into the new file
