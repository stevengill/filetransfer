The contents of this folder are generated by running the Makefile at the parent directory.
"make xcode4-template"

NOTE:
Adding a folder reference through the template definition is currently unknown, and current attempts in figuring it out are buggy. For now, you will need to create the "www" folder (and the index.html within it), yourself in your project folder - then drag and drop the "www" folder into your Xcode project.
