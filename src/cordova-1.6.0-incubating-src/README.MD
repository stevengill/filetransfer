What is it?
-------------------
Cordova is a web platform that exposes native mobile device apis and
data to JavaScript. Previously known as PhoneGap, the name changed
happened when PhoneGap was donated to the Apache foundation.

Currently Apache Cordova is an effort undergoing incubation at The
Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator
project. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a
further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.

Why?
-------------------
Mobile development is a mess. Building applications for each
device--iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile and more--requires different
frameworks and languages. One day, the big players in mobile may decide
to work together and unify third-party app development processes. Until
then, Cordova will use standards-based web technologies to bridge web
applications and mobile devices. Plus, because Cordova apps are
standards compliant, theyâ€™re future-proofed to work with browsers as
they evolve. Cordova is an open source implementation of open
standards. That means developers and companies can use Cordova for
mobile applications that are free, commercial, open source, or any
combination of these.

As time goes on, these will be ideally moved to an Apache hosted site or
be renamed to the Apache Cordova Brand.
